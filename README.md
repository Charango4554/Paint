# Paint
This program allows you to draw on a graphic window by clicking and dragging the mouse. The drawing is drawn in black.

Here is a program I did in a "Visual Interafce" course at my university.

The Drawing program allows the user to draw on a graphic window using the mouse. When the user clicks the mouse, the coordinates of the place where he clicked are recorded. When he starts dragging the mouse, a drawing is drawn on the graphics window using the previously saved coordinates and the current mouse coordinates. The drawing is drawn in black.

When the user releases the mouse button, the current drawing is finished.
